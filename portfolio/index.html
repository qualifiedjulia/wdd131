    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Julia Garcia. I am in my fourth year of studying illustration with an emphasis in publishing at BYUI. 
        By day I'm doing homework and making art, but by night I am also doing homework and making art. In my free time 
        I enjoy playing video games, watching shows, and learning new forms of making art (which is currently animation!).

    <p>
        Below are some of the illustrations from my portfolio. These artworks are some of the newest and proudest additions 
        to my portfolio, so I have put them here (on the home page) to show them off.
