<div id="myTextBox" class="textBox">
        "The Angel Box"- This illustration was inspired by a creature i created called the "angel box" which
        was also inspired by certain depictions of angels. It is meant to evoke a sense of awe and simultaneous 
        fear as you wonder if its here to bring blessings or destruction upon you.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-2" class="textBox">
        "Observer"- a collection of eyes staring in all directions. It is meant to give the same feeling that The Angel Box did, 
        but almost acting as a dark reflection to it. This creature holds no grace and knows no divinity.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-3" class="textBox">
        "Spider Girl"- A young girl changed by the environment she hasfound herself in. This girl has truly learned what it 
        means to adapt to survive, and is no longer the person she entered this domain as.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-4" class="textBox">
        "No Control"- What do you become when you are destroyed and then rebuilt again, but not as who you once were?
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-5" class="textBox">
        "Chew and Swallow"- Inspired by a short story I wrote, a young girl is forced into a horrifying new environment.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-6" class="textBox">
        "Sunset on the Beach"- The same girl in "Chew and swallow" shown reflecting on her past and the person she used to be.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-7" class="textBox">
        "Stop Looking at Me"- A mass and tangle of muscles and eyes too large to observe in its entirety.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-8" class="textBox">
        "Escape Divinity"- Running away from who you were meant to be and supposed to become. A careless or careful descision 
        that has consequences.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-9" class="textBox">
        "Undead"- Inspired by a comic idea I had a while ago now. A boy trying to grow up dies, but not quite in the right way.
        He has come back different and with new abilities.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-10" class="textBox">
        "Not a Monster"- A demon that looks to be some kind of furry dog-like horse.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-11" class="textBox">
        "Laundry Time"- A painting of a photo I took once. The light of a sunny day passes through laundry detergent pods quite 
        beautifully.
</div>
<div id="myTextBox-12" class="textBox">
        "Deerest"- A deer one, not quite human on the inside.

    <h3>About my Art</h3>
    <p>
        Although I love experimenting with many different forms of art, my favorite medium has to be a tie between digital 
        and Ink. I definitely feel most connected to the art i make in those two fields. I've been loving digital art for 
        many years, but it has only been recently that I have started to fall in love with making art with ink as well.
        <br><br>
        The area in which I thrive in making art is definitely character focused pieces. My pieces of art that focus on 
        the personality and motivations of one or more characters is my bread and butter. I love diving into different 
        characters and what makes them unique and drives their motivations. My dream is to make comics, and that dream is 
        definitely driven by my love for looking deaper into the subjects of my art.
