				This page will serve as an introduction to me and my art and have a section that 
				features the works that I am currently most proud of.
				<br><br>
				My name is Julia Garcia. I am in my fourth year of studying illustration with an emphasis in publishing 
				at BYUI. By day I'm doing homework and making art, but by night I am also doing homework and making art. In 
				my free time I enjoy playing video games, watching shows, and learning new forms of making art (which is currently
				animation!). 
				<br><br>
				Below are some of the illustrations from my portfolio. These artworks are some of the newest and proudest additions to 
				my portfolio, so I have put them here (on the home page) to show them off.
			</p>
			<h3>Portfolio Page</h3>

				This page will have a short description about my art and what I want to do with it in the future:
				<br><br>
				Although I love experimenting with many different forms of art, my favorite medium has to be a tie between 
				digital and Ink. I definitely feel most connected to the art i make in those two fields. I've been loving digital 
				art for many years, but it has only been recently that I have started to fall in love with making art with ink as well.
				<br><br>
				The area in which I thrive in making art is definitely character focused pieces. My pieces of art that focus on 
				the personality and motivations of one or more characters is my bread and butter. I love diving into different characters 
				and what makes them unique and drives their motivations. My dream is to make comics, and that dream is definitely driven 
				by my love for looking deaper into the subjects of my art.
				<br><br>
				This section will also have some javascript added in to make each image have a description of the artwork pop up and drop 
				down when the artwork is selected.
